        <p>Chuck ‘n Hammer Services is owned by Charlie Hauser. He has always had an <br>interest in learning more, helping people, and being handy, so he got into <br>constuction and found a passion of working hard and getting thing done right the <br>first time. He loves the outdoors, which is a perk of his job since he is outdoors <br>most of the time. If he isn’t working, he is spending time with his family, in the <br>woods hunting or doing his own foodplots, fishing, or snowmobiling. Chuck ’n <br>Hammer is located in Throp, Wisconsin, but that doesn’t bound them to just that <br>area. They travel up to 2 hours away and are ready to get the job done right, quick, <br>and effiecently. He works with a few other men who also strive to produce the best <br>work they can. One thing Chuck ‘n Hammer can guarentee: satisfaction. </p>
