        <p>Chuck ‘n Hammer Services is owned by Charlie Hauser. He has always had an interest in learning more, helping people, and being handy, so he got into constuction and found a passion of working hard and getting thing done right the first time. He loves the outdoors, which is a perk of his job since he is outdoors most of the time. If he isn’t working, he is spending time with his family, in the woods hunting or doing his own foodplots, fishing, or snowmobiling. Chuck ’n Hammer is located in Thorp, Wisconsin, but that doesn’t bound them to just that area. They travel up to 2 hours away and are ready to get the job done right, quick, and effiecently. He works with a few other men who also strive to produce the best work they can. One thing Chuck ‘n Hammer can guarentee: satisfaction. </p>
